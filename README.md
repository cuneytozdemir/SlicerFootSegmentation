AI-powered automatic 3D foot segmentation extension for 3D Slicer.

![Extension Preview](SlicerFootSegmentation/Resources/fig_segmentation_examples.png)

 Description

This extension provides automatic segmentation of foot structures from 3D medical images (NIfTI/DICOM) using a deep learning model. The model is based on 3D U-Net architecture and converted to ONNX format for optimal performance.

 Features

- 🔬 Automatic Segmentation: One-click foot segmentation
- ⚡ Fast Inference: ONNX Runtime for optimized performance
- 🖥️ GPU Support: Optional CUDA acceleration
- 📊 Adjustable Parameters: Threshold and overlap settings
- 🌍 Multi-language UI: Turkish interface for medical professionals

 Installation
